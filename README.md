## Cheetah CLI

Use command line to download a file with multiple parallel connections. It uses [Cheetah Downloader](https://github.com/cheetahapp/downloader) behind the scene.


### Install

Yarn or NPM, you know the drill.

```bash
npm i cheetah-cli -g
```

### Usage

```bash
cheetah [targetDirectory]
```

It'll ask for the URL to download, just paste and enter.

> targetDirectory will be `~/Downloads` by default.
